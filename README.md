### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm NanoS, a 13 year old developer. The primary languages I code in are Java, Rust and Python, though I have also been learning C++ recently.

I also play a lot of different games, primarily Minecraft, which I also frequently mod for fun.

I like working on random projects whenever I feel like it, that's pretty much all of my public repos summed up.

Add me on discord if you feel like it, my tag is NanoS#9999
